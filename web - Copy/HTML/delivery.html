          TechShop pick and pack your items, even gift-wrapping eligible
          packages upon request. Once packed, your order joins a line haul
          trailer alongside many other customer orders. These trailers transport
          packages to TechShop Air sites, where they’re loaded onto aircraft.
          TechShop's fleet of over 110 aircraft ensures efficient
          transportation. When an aircraft lands at its destination, the next
          step in the journey is a sort center. Here, packages are sorted by ZIP
          code before being sent to delivery stations or partner facilities like
          U.S. Post Offices. At the delivery station, an TechShop employee
          organizes packages based on delivery routes. Delivery drivers then
          load the packages onto their vehicles. When your package is en route,
          you receive notifications, and it’s delivered to your front door or
          another pickup point, such as an TechShop Locker.
