          1. **Overview**: - The MacBook brand replaced the PowerBook and iBook
          brands during the Mac transition to Intel processors in 2005. - The
          current lineup includes the **MacBook Air** (2008–present) and the
          MacBook Pro (2006–present). - Two different lines simply named
          "MacBook" existed from 2006 to 2012 and 2015 to 2019. - The MacBook
          family features unibody aluminum construction, backlit keyboards, and
          lids held closed by magnets. - Memory, drives, and batteries are now
          soldered or glued in place in the newer models. 2. MacBook
          (2006–2012): - As part of the Mac transition to Intel processors,
          Apple released a 13-inch laptop simply named "MacBook." - It served as
          an entry-level laptop, less expensive than the MacBook Pro and later
          the MacBook Air. - It was aimed at consumers and education markets and
          was the best-selling Mac during its existence. 3. MacBook Pro: - The
          MacBook Pro is the higher-end lineup in the MacBook family, introduced
          in January 2006. - It currently comes with 14-inch and 16-inch
          screens, using Apple silicon M-series chips.
